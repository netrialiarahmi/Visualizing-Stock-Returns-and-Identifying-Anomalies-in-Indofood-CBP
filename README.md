# Visualizing-Stock-Returns-and-Identifying-Anomalies-in-Indofood-CBP
This repository contains code to download and visualize the historical stock price data of Indofood CBP, one of the largest consumer goods companies in Indonesia. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and yfinance, the repository provides an easy way to visualize the daily stock returns, and identify any anomalies or outliers that may exist in the data.

The repository's main script downloads the stock price data from Yahoo Finance and calculates the daily simple returns of the stock using Pandas. Then, the script calculates the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) of the returns, which is used to identify any anomalies that may exist in the data. Finally, the script plots the daily returns along with the EWMA and any identified anomalies.

The repository is useful for anyone who is interested in analyzing the stock market and understanding the behavior of stock returns. It can also be used as a starting point for more advanced analysis and modeling of stock returns.
